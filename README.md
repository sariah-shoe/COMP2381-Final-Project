# COMP2381-Final-Project
My final project for COMP 2381. I was given a working program and tasked with making it more object-oriented. 
In order to do this I implemented new data organization using objects, a command pattern, and a state pattern.

This repository contains the original code that I was given, along with my object-oriented implementation.
I have also included a UML diagram of my implementation.

This code requires the DUdraw library to run.
